    "\n",
    "From Fred Blundun comes a simple game of definitive diffidence:\n",
    "\n",
    "Martina and Olivia each secretly generate their own random real number, selected uniformly between 0 and 1. Starting with Martina, they take turns declaring (so the other can hear) who they think probably has the greater number until the first moment they agree. Throughout this process, their respective numbers do not change. So for example, their dialogue might go as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Martina: My number is probably bigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Olivia: My number is probably bigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Martina: My number is probably bigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Olivia: My number is probably bigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Martina: Oliviaâ€™s number is probably bigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "They are playing as a team, hoping to maximize the chances they correctly predict who has the greater number.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any given round with randomly generated numbers, what is the probability that the person they agree on really does have the bigger number?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Thoughts:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the comment on maximizing chances, it makes me wonder if some kind of strategy can be employed where their likelihood of saying \"my number is probably bigger\" is associated with the value of their number. \n",
    "\n",
    "E.g. If my number is 0.05 I doubt my number is bigger, however if my number is 0.99 I am pretty confident my number is bigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Need to model out a confidence value, which I think could be used in conjunction with the sequence of the conversation:\n",
    "- `n` = max sequence size, dictated by how precise we want to be (.1 increments use 10, .01 use 100, etc.).\n",
    "- In each round each user's comment will represent a step in our sequence to n, at which point their is a tie of 1?"
