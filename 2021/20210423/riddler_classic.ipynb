    "Riddler Nationâ€™s neighbor to the west, Enigmerica, is holding an election between two candidates, A and B. Assume every person in Enigmerica votes randomly and independently, and that the number of voters is very, very large. Moreover, due to health precautions, 20 percent of the population decides to vote early by mail.\n",
    "\n",
    "On election night, the results of the 80 percent who voted on Election Day are reported out. Over the next several days, the remaining 20 percent of the votes are then tallied.\n",

    "\n",
    "1) Determine range of % of vote where it is feasible for a candidate to be behind & then take the lead\n",
    "- The only way a candidate can come back after losing assuming 20% of vote is left is if they can exceed 50%. \n",
    "- This means the mininum is going to be 30% of total, which translates to 3/8 = .375 of the day of vote (+1 vote)\n",
    "- The max will be the halfway point of the vote on Election day, or 40% of total (4/8 = 0.5) (-1 vote)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Once range is established can sum up the likelihood of discrete vote counts (e.g. P(Win | 30% Day of), P(Win | 30.1% Day of), ....)\n",
    "- For each vote amount in the range established can solve the following: \n",
    "    - Likelihood of that vote amount ---> P(X = x)\n",
    "    - Likelihood of enough votes out of those from mail-in  ---> P(X >= x)\n",
    "- Summing up the values will yield the solution\n"
