    "From Ricky Jacobson comes a party game that’s just in time for Halloween:\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of playing hot potato, you and 60 of your closest friends decide to play a socially distanced game of hot pumpkin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the game starts, you all sit in a circle and agree on a positive integer N. Once the number has been chosen, you (the leader of the group) start the game by counting “1” and passing the pumpkin to the person sitting directly to your left. She then declares “2” and passes the pumpkin one space to her left. This continues with each player saying the next number in the sequence, wrapping around the circle as many times as necessary, until the group has collectively counted up to N. At that point, the player who counted “N” is eliminated, and the player directly to his or her left starts the next round, again proceeding to the same value of N. The game continues until just one player remains, who is declared the victor.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the game’s first round, the player 18 spaces to your left is the first to be eliminated. Ricky, the next player in the sequence, begins the next round. The second round sees the elimination of the player 31 spaces to Ricky’s left. Zach begins the third round, only to find himself eliminated in a cruel twist of fate. (Woe is Zach.)\n",

    "- Identify all possible values for `N` across the three scenarios above. Find overlapping values and identify mininum. "
