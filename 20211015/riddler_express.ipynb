    "The American League Championship Series of Riddler League Baseball determines one of the teams that will compete in the Riddler World Series. This year’s teams — the Tampa Bay Lines and the Minnesota Twin Primes — are evenly matched. In other words, both teams are equally likely to win each game of the best-of-seven series.\n",

    "- We can solve for expected value based on likelihood of each combinations of games to win\n",
    "- Each likelihood is `0.5**n`\n",
    "- Able to solve as \"the number of different groups of `r` objects each, which can be formed from the available `n` objects.\" \n",
    "    - Where `n` will represent total games played and `r` will represent 4 each time (e.g. likelihood of `T-F-T-T-T` or `n-4` (for the likelihood of something like `F-F-T-T-F-F`)\n",
    "- Need to remove any repeated sequences:\n",
    "        - e.g. `T-T-T-T` is covered in one of the combinations of 5 as `T-T-T-T-F`\n",
    "        - This can be done by substracting off combination where `n = n-1` and `r=r`"
