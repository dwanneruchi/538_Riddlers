    "From Dave Moran comes a pill-popping puzzle:\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ve been prescribed to take 1.5 pills of a certain medication every day for 10 days, so I have a bottle with 15 pills. Each morning, I take two pills out of the bottle at random.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the first morning, these are guaranteed to be two full pills. I consume one of them, split the other in half using a precision blade, consume half of that second pill, and place the remaining half back into the bottle.\n",
    "\n",
    "On subsequent mornings when I take out two pills, there are three possibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "I get two full pills. As on the first morning, I split one and place the unused half back into the bottle.\n",
    "I get one full pill and one half-pill, both of which I consume.\n",
    "I get two half-pills. In this case, I take out another pill at random. If it’s a half-pill, then I consume all three halves. But if it’s a full pill, I split it and place the unused half back in the bottle.\n",
    "Assume that each pill — whether it is a full pill or a half-pill — is equally likely to be taken out of the bottle.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the 10th day, I again take out two pills and consume them. In a rush, I immediately throw the bottle in the trash before bothering to check whether I had just consumed full pills or half-pills. What’s the probability that I took the full dosage, meaning I don’t have to dig through the trash for a remaining half-pill?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Things To Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We are guaranteed to NOT exceed given we have 15 pills over 10 days and need 1.5 per day. I only note this so I can recognize that on the 10th day I only need to be concerned with being under or equal to 1.5 pills.\n"
