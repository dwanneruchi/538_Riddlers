    "Trapezoidal numbers are whole numbers that can be written as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. For example, 9 is a trapezoidal number because it can be written as 2+3+4. In fact, 9 is doubly trapezoidal because it can also be written as 4+5. (By the way, triangular numbers are also trapezoidal. Iâ€™m a fan of inclusive definitions like these.)\n",
