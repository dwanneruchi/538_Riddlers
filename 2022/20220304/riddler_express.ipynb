    "You have three fair coins, three fair dice and a full deck of cards in your possession. First, you flip all three coins and note the number of heads. Next, you toss all three dice and note the number of ones or sixes. Finally, you draw three random cards from the deck of 52 and note the number of hearts.\n",

    "- We know that independent events (which these all are) adhere to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(A \\cap B \\cap C) = P(A) P(B) P(C)$\n",
    "\n",
    "- We know that the sum of all possible combinations of A, B and C is 1, meaning we can sum up the joint probability across each state (0,1,2,3)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, we can use `combinations` to fully capture probability of events with more than one ordering of sequences. \n",
    "    - Example: Likelihood of flipping 2 heads?\n",
    "    - This can occur as: THH, HTH, or HHT -> 3/(2^3) = 0.375\n",
    "    - Alternatively, we can solve this as: 3C1 * (prob H) * (prob T * prob T) = 3 * 0.5 * (0.5^2) = 0.375\n",
    "    - The latter being the number of combinations times the probability of event"
