Also, this being the Riddler Ski Federation, you have been presented detailed data on both you and your opponent. You are evenly matched, and both have the same normal probability distribution of finishing times for each run. And for both of you, your time on the first run is completely independent of your time on the second run.\n",

Without knowing either exact time, what’s the probability that you will still be ahead after the second run and earn your gold medal?\n",
