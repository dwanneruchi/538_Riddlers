    "    - A crash is missed only in the following scenarios: \n",
    "        1) Car A is inside of Car B route (e.g. Car A: 2 -> 3, Car B: 1 -> 6)\n",
    "        2) Car B is inside of Car A route (e.g. Car A: 6 -> 2, Car B: 3 -> 5)\n",
    "        3) Car A & Car B are totally disjoint (e.g. Car A: 2 -> 7, Car B: 8 -> 1)\n",
    "    - Anything else would qualify as a crash:\n",
    "        - Assumption 1: If Car A Leaves 1 and Lands in 2, and Car B Leaves 4 and Lands in 1 that this qualifies as a crash.\n",
    "            - `@xaqwg` on Twitter said as much: https://twitter.com/Donald_Adamek/status/1405879172019404800\n",
    "        - Assumption 2: If Car A & B end in the same place, also counts as a Crash (confirmed in riddler) "
