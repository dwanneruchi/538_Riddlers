    "From mathematician (and author of Basic Probability: What Every Math Student Should Know) Henk Tijms comes a choice matter of chance and chocolate:\n",
    "\n",
    "```I have 10 chocolates in a bag: Two are milk chocolate, while the other eight are dark chocolate. One at a time, I randomly pull chocolates from the bag and eat them — that is, until I pick a chocolate of the other kind. When I get to the other type of chocolate, I put it back in the bag and start drawing again with the remaining chocolates. I keep going until I have eaten all 10 chocolates.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if I first pull out a dark chocolate, I will eat it. (I’ll always eat the first chocolate I pull out.) If I pull out a second dark chocolate, I will eat that as well. If the third one is milk chocolate, I will not eat it (yet), and instead place it back in the bag. Then I will start again, eating the first chocolate I pull out.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the chances that the last chocolate I eat is milk chocolate?\n",
    "```\n",
